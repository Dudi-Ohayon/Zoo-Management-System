## Introduction

The Zoo Management System is designed to help manage and organize a zoo's operations. It allows zoo keepers to keep track of animals and their specific details. The system is built with a focus on object-oriented programming principles to ensure maintainability, extensibility, and efficient development.


## Features

- **Dashboard Feature:**
  - The main form includes a dashboard display, providing a quick overview of the zoo's operations.
  One notable feature is the total count of all animals in the zoo, conveniently visible on the main form.
  This dashboard functionality enhances accessibility and allows zoo keepers to monitor the zoo's animal population effortlessly.

- **Animal Management:**
  - Add new animals to the database (e.g., lion, shark, elephant).
  - Remove animals from the database.
  - Print a list of current animals.

- **Serialization:**
  - Save the data to a file using serialization.
  - Load the data from a file using deserialization.

- **Audio Feedback:**
  - Play a sound corresponding to the added animal (e.g., lion's roar) when adding a new animal.

## Technologies

- **C#:** The primary programming language used for development.
- **WinForms:** The graphical user interface framework used to create the application.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Implemented OOP principles for a structured and maintainable codebase.

## Screenshots

- The screenshots provided in this README predominantly showcase the lion section of the Zoo Management System.
  While the application encompasses a broader range of animals, such as elephants and sharks, the focus on lion screenshots is for illustrative purposes.
  The lion section is highlighted to demonstrate a representative view of the animal management interface.
  The application's functionality extends to managing other animals like elephants and sharks in a similar manner.
  For a comprehensive understanding of the system's capabilities, I recommend exploring the application directly.
