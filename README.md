  - Load the data from a file using deserialization.

- **Audio Feedback:**
  - Play a sound corresponding to the added animal (e.g., lion's roar) when adding a new animal.

## Technologies

- **C#:** The primary programming language used for development.
- **WinForms:** The graphical user interface framework used to create the application.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Implemented OOP principles for a structured and maintainable codebase.
