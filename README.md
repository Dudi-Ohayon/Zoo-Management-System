## Introduction

The Zoo Management System is designed to help manage and organize a zoo's operations. It allows zoo keepers to keep track of animals and their specific details. The system is built with a focus on object-oriented programming principles to ensure maintainability, extensibility, and efficient development.


## Features

- **Animal Management:**
  - Add new animals to the database (e.g., lion, shark, elephant).
  - Remove animals from the database.
  - Print a list of current animals.

- **Serialization:**
  - Save the data to a file using serialization.
  - Load the data from a file using deserialization.

- **Audio Feedback:**
  - Play a sound corresponding to the added animal (e.g., lion's roar) when adding a new animal.

## Technologies

- **C#:** The primary programming language used for development.
- **WinForms:** The graphical user interface framework used to create the application.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Implemented OOP principles for a structured and maintainable codebase.
